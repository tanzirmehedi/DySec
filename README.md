# DySec
A Machine Learning-based Dynamic Analysis for Detecting Malicious Packages in PyPI Ecosystem

## Overview

QUT-DV25 is a comprehensive dataset designed to support research into the detection of malicious activity in the Python Package Index (PyPI) ecosystem. It provides multi-layered behavioral traces from dynamic analysis of Python package installations and executions, captured via eBPF-based observability tools on Raspberry Pi systems running Ubuntu 24.4 LTS.
